# Module 7: Google Search Redesign
 You will be working on designing a google search page. Letâ€™s get started.

- Visit `<a href="httpsS://www.google.com/"><b><u class="cdx-underline">google.com</u></b></a> and search for either Lionel Messi or Christiano Ronaldo.&nbsp;`
- Using HTML and CSS, redesign just the first page of your search result
- Video content in your search result should be replaced with images if you cannot add the actual video content to your design
Scoring Criteria

# We would be looking out for;

- How you sectionalize your pages
- Use of font
- Closeness of your design to the search result.
Good luck!!
